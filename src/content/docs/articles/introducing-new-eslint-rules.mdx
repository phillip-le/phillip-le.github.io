## Introducing new ESLint rules to an existing project

### Why linting is important

Linters offer a way of enforcing code quality and consistency in a codebase.
They can help you catch bugs, enforce best practices, and ensure that your code is
readable and maintainable.

Linters are also an **automated** way of enforcing practices which means that we can
spend less time writing nitpicks in code reviews and more time thinking about the bigger picture
like if the code is solving the right problem, whether or not it will be performant, etc.

Gunnar Morling's [visualisation of the code review pyramid](https://www.morling.dev/blog/the-code-review-pyramid/)
nicely shows what we should be focussing on in code reviews.

Evan Smith points out in his article about [Kind Engineering](https://kind.engineering/) that
people tend to be more open to receiving many nitpicks from a linter than from a dozen comments on a PR.

### Choosing which rules to add

How do we choose which rules to add to our ESLint configuration?

Determining which rules to enable individually can be time-consuming in terms of discussing and
justifying whether or not you need the rule. So, generally it's better to start with a config that
defines a recommended set of rules. Not every rule in the recommended config will be applicable but
they are a good starting point. It is much easier to disable specific rules than to enable them one by one.

You can see a list of recommended configs in my article on [awesome linters](https://phillip-le.github.io/articles/linters/).

If you are interested in looking at a production grade ESLint configuration, you can check out the
[SEEK skuba ESLint Config](https://github.com/seek-oss/skuba/blob/main/packages/eslint-config-skuba/index.js)
which extends the [SEEK base ESLint Config](https://github.com/seek-oss/eslint-config-seek/blob/master/base.js).

It is important to note that even if you do not agree with the opinion of a rule, it is usually
better to have consistency within the codebase rather than different code styles. For example, `jest` and
`vitest` expose aliases for writing tests under the [test](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout) and
`it` functions. So, think about whether you really want to disable a rule from a recommended config.

```ts
// Exactly the same test
test('should add up two numbers', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 1)).toBe(2);
});

it('should add up two numbers', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 1)).toBe(2);
});
```

### How to ignore existing violations

The best time to introduce linting rules is at the start of a project, so that you do not have to
worry about fixing a large number of issues later on. If you are working on an existing project,
introducing a new recommended set of rules can be a daunting task because your first run of the linter
may show hundreds or thousands of errors.

Do not be discouraged by this! Some of these errors can be fixed automatically using the [--fix](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--fix) ESLint option.

import AllPackageManagers from '../../../components/AllPackageManagers.astro';

<AllPackageManagers type="exec" pkg="eslint" args="--fix file.ts" />

Not every issue will be fixable automatically, but this lets us focus on the issues that may
require more thought.

From here, you can choose to change the severity of the rule to a warning or disable it entirely.
For example,

```js
{
    "rules": {
        "no-unused-vars": "warn",
        "no-unsafe-argument": "off"
    }
}
```

This is usually done because the effort to make the codebase compliant with the rule is high.
However, I do not recommend this because there is significant value in having a linter that is able
to enforce rules by failing a build in CI. Setting rules to `warn` tends to lead to new violations
being introduced. So, ideally we would be able to ignore existing violations and enforce the rule
for new changes.

So, I recommend using a tool called [eslint-interactive](https://github.com/mizdra/eslint-interactive/)
which allow us to quickly deal with the remaining issues.

<AllPackageManagers
  pkg="eslint-interactive"
  comment="Install eslint-interactive@10 for ESLint < v9"
/>

You can start using `eslint-interactive` by running the following command:

<AllPackageManagers type="exec" pkg="eslint-interactive ./src" />

`eslint-interactive` will lint the files in the `./src` directory, summarise the number of issues by rule
and then allow you to select which rules you want to deal with first.

```sh
✔ Linting done.

- 150 files (146 files passed, 4 files failed) checked.
- 4 problems (4 errors, 0 warning) found.
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╤═══════╤═════════╤════════════╤═════════════════╗

? Which rules would you like to apply action? …  Select all you want with <space> key.
✔ @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function
✔ @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument
✔ @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
```

After selecting a rule, you can explore the issues that have been found and choose an action to take.

```sh
✔ Which rules would you like to apply action? · @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function
? Which action do you want to do? …
❯ 🔎 Display details of lint results
  🔧 Run `eslint --fix` (disabled)
  🔧 Disable per line
  🔧 Disable per file
  🔧 Convert error to warning per file
  🔧 Apply suggestions (experimental, for experts) (disabled)
  🔧 Make forcibly fixable and run `eslint --fix` (experimental, for experts)
  ↩️  Reselect rules
```

I have found that the most useful option is to `Disable per line` which will add a `// eslint-disable-line`
comment to the line that is causing the issue. This allows us to ignore the issue for now and come
back to it later. We can also include additional information in the comment such as a JIRA ticket number
or a `TODO` which will make it easier to find the issue later.

```sh
✔ Which action do you want to do? · disablePerLine
✔ Leave a code comment with your reason for fixing (Optional) · TODO JIRA-123
✔ Where would you like to position the code comment? · sameLine
✔ Fixing done.
```

`eslint-interactive` will write out the changes to the files.

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line unicorn/no-await-expression-member -- TODO JIRA-123
```

:::caution
If you do not see any files changed, you may be running an incompatible version of `eslint-interactive`.
Try using `eslint-interactive@10` for ESLint versions less than 9.
:::

This approach allows us to quickly introduce new rulesets, ignore existing issues and gain the benefits of
using those stricter rules for future changes. As we work on the codebase, we can gradually fix the existing
issues and remove the `eslint-disable-line` comments.

To ensure that our `eslint-disable-line` comments are
actively being used to suppress issues, we can use the [--report-unused-disable-directives](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--report-unused-disable-directives) ESLint option.

<AllPackageManagers
  type="exec"
  pkg="eslint"
  args="--fix --report-unused-disable-directives file.ts"
/>

Paired with the `--fix` flag, ESLint will automatically remove any unused `eslint-disable-line` comments.

## Fixing existing violations

One of the downsides of gradually chipping away at existing issues is that for large existing codebases
with thousands of issues, it can take a very long time to make the codebase compliant with the new rules.
This is because we are limited to developers resolving issues one by one.

So, how can we scale up our efforts to fix existing issues?

### Using ESLint suggestions

Sometimes, an ESLint rule will have some [suggestions](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/main/designs/2019-suggestions)
on how to resolve an issue but the fix is not always correct. So, some level of human oversight is required.
Usually, these suggestions can be applied in an IDE but how do we apply them to a large number of issues at once?

You can use `eslint-interactive` to apply suggestions. When you select a rule to apply an action to, you can
select `Apply suggestions` if there are applicable suggestions. It's a good idea to first review the suggestions
to ensure that they are correct by first selecting `🔎 Display details of lint results`.

:::caution
When selecting `Apply suggestions`, `eslint-interactive` will attempt to open an editor but this may
fail silently, see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mizdra/eslint-interactive/issues/328) to resolve this.
:::

If we want to roll out fixes using suggestions over a large number of projects, using the interactive CLI
is inefficient. Instead, we can use the [eslint-interactive's Programmable API](https://github.com/mizdra/eslint-interactive/blob/main/docs/programmable-api.md).

A good approach I have found is to explore the suggestions provided by the rules using `eslint-interactive`
and whitelist the rules with suggestions that I trust. Then, I can use a script to roll out the fixes
using the suggestions quickly.

import applyWhitelistedSuggestions from '/src/examples/raising-code-quality-at-scale/applying-whitelisted-suggestions.ts?raw';
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<details>
  <summary>Script for applying whitelisted suggestions</summary>
  <Code code={applyWhitelistedSuggestions} lang="ts" />
</details>

### Using codemods

Codemods are programs that use code to refactor your code. One of the most popular ways to write
codemods for JavsScript has been to use [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).
However, this has required learning the underlying Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of JavaScript, how to manipulate
the ASTs and writing tests for your codemods is often more work than expected.

I have found that using [grit](https://github.com/getgrit/gritql?tab=readme-ov-file#why-gritql) is a much
nicer experience. `grit` allows you to mostly write your codemods using JavaScript syntax while taking
advantage of [matching against the underlying AST](https://docs.grit.io/language/patterns#syntax-tree-ast-nodes).
`grit` is also incredibly fast.

One instance where I have found `grit` to be useful has been to refactor default exports to named exports.

I can enforce this using ESLint, with [no-restricted-exports](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-restricted-exports#restrictdefaultexports)

```ts
{
    'no-restricted-exports': ['error', { restrictDefaultExports: { direct: true } }],
}
```

However, it would be very time consuming to manually refactor all the default exports to named exports.
Fortunately, `grit` has a standard library pattern to migrate [default imports to named imports](https://docs.grit.io/patterns/library/migrate_default_imports).
So, I can run the following command to apply the codemod.

```sh
grit apply migrate_default_imports
```

I was also able to write my own simpler `grit` pattern which was curated for my codebases.

```sh
or {
    `export default $export` => `export { $export }`,
    `import $alias from $source` => `import { $alias } from $source` where {
        and {
          $alias <: not contains `{ $imports }`,
          $alias <: not r"\* as .*",
          $source <: r".\..*",
          $source <: not r".*json."
        }
    }
}
```

This pattern replaces named default exports with a named export.

```javascript
// Before
const hello = () => {
  console.log('hello');
};

export default hello;
```

```javascript
// After
const hello = () => {
  console.log('hello');
};

export { hello };
```

It also replaces default imports with named imports and ensures that other imports are unaffected.

```js
// Before
import hello from './hello';
import 'aws-sdk-client-mock';
import { world } from './world';
import * as stream from './stream';
import me from 'me';
import schema from '../../validation/schema.json';
```

```js
// After
import { hello } from './hello';
import 'aws-sdk-client-mock';
import { world } from './world';
import * as stream from './stream';
import me from 'me';
import schema from '../../validation/schema.json';
```

Another great part about `grit` is that code snippets included above can be used as [tests](https://docs.grit.io/guides/testing)
to ensure that the codemod is working as expected. This is much simpler than setting up files, running the codemod
and comparing the modified files with a correctly modified file.

### Using ESLint information to guide LLMs

I recently came across an article called [How to Fix ESLint Violations with AI Assistance](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-fix-eslint-violations-with-ai-assistance/)
and was inspired by the success of [Slack migrating from Enzyme to React Testing Library using codemods and LLMs](https://slack.engineering/balancing-old-tricks-with-new-feats-ai-powered-conversion-from-enzyme-to-react-testing-library-at-slack/).
I have been using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for a while now but one of the limitations
with Copilot has been that I cannot use it programmatically.

Could we use LLMs to help fix ESLint issues at scale?

My first attempt was to use [node-llama-cpp](https://node-llama-cpp.withcat.ai/guide/) which lets you
easily run LLMs locally with a nice JavaScript API. For most of my experiments I used [llama3.1 8B](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)
which is a a lightweight open-source model by Meta that was the best I could run on my local machine.

I would generate a list of ESLint issues using `eslint-interactive` in JSON format and then give the LLM the
ability to read the ESLint issues using the [function calling](https://node-llama-cpp.withcat.ai/guide/function-calling)
feature of `node-llama-cpp`.

<AllPackageManagers type="exec" pkg="eslint-interactive" args="--format json" />

Unfortunately, I ran into one big deal breaker: it was very difficult to get the LLM to generate fixes in
a suitable format. It was especially important that any fixes that were created could be easily inserted
into the original code.

Next, I came across [aider](https://aider.chat/), an AI pair programming CLI tool that hooks into
many different LLMs and is specifically designed to handle structuring and inserting the LLM outputs
into your codebase. `aider` also has a [programmatic API](https://aider.chat/docs/scripting.html) which
means that we can use it to fix ESLint issues at scale.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<details>
<summary>
Some details about how I setup `aider`
</summary>

<Steps>
1. Install [aider using pipx](https://aider.chat/docs/install/pipx.html):

    ```sh
    pipx install aider-chat
    ```

2.  I used [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/) to handle running `llama3.1 8B` locally. You can install `ollama` using Homebrew:

    ```sh
    brew install ollama
    ```

3.  You will need to run `ollama` in a separate terminal window.

    ```sh
    ollama serve
    ```

4.  And pull the model that you wish to use:

    ```sh
    ollama pull llama3.1
    ```

5.  You can [interactively test `aider` with `llama3.1 8B`](https://aider.chat/docs/llms/ollama.html) by running and
    seeing how it reacts to the prompt: "Hello":

        ```sh
        OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434 aider --model ollama/llama3.1
        ```

</Steps>
</details>

My strategy for using `aider` was:

Use `eslint-interactive` to generate a list of ESLint issues.

```ts
import { Core, type ESLintOptions } from 'eslint-interactive';

const core = new Core({
  patterns: ['src', 'spec'],
  eslintOptions: {
    type: 'flat',
  } as ESLintOptions,
});

const results = await core.lint();
```

Filter the issues to only include issues that I trust `aider` to fix.

```ts
const filteredResults = results.filter((result) =>
  result.messages.some(
    (message) => message.ruleId === 'unicorn/no-await-expression-member',
  ),
);
```

Construct a prompt for `aider` to fix one file and one rule at a time.

```ts
function convertToRelativePath(absolutePath: string): string {
  const currentWorkingDirectory = process.cwd();
  return path.relative(currentWorkingDirectory, absolutePath);
}

const ruleToBasePromptGuidance: Record<string, string> = {
  'unicorn/no-await-expression-member':
    'This means that we need to await the promise and then destructure on a separate line.',
};

const createPromptWithRelativeFilePaths = ({
  eslintResults,
  ruleId,
}: {
  eslintResults: ESLint.LintResult[];
  ruleId: string;
}) => {
  return eslintResults
    .filter((result) =>
      result.messages.some((message) => message.ruleId === ruleId),
    )
    .map((result) => {
      const relativeFilePath = convertToRelativePath(result.filePath);
      const basePrompt = `The file ${relativeFilePath} has the ESLint issue: ${ruleId}. ${ruleToBasePromptGuidance[ruleId]} Specific information about
    where the issues occur are as follows:`;
      const messageIssues = result.messages
        .filter((message) => message.ruleId === ruleId)
        .map((message) => {
          return `${message.message} at line ${message.line} and column ${message.column}`;
        });
      return {
        prompt: `${basePrompt}\n${messageIssues.join('\n')}`,
        relativeFilePath,
      };
    });
};
```

This results in a prompt that looks like:

> The file src/file.ts has the ESLint issue: unicorn/no-await-expression-member. This means that we need to await the promise and then destructure on a separate line. Specific information about
> where the issues occur are as follows:
>
> Do not access a member directly from an await expression. at line 14 and column 58
>
> Do not access a member directly from an await expression. at line 25 and column 58

I can then use [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) to run `aider` CLI from JavaScript.

```ts
import { $ } from 'zx';

const promptWithRelativeFilePaths = createPromptWithRelativeFilePaths({
  eslintResults: results,
  ruleId: 'unicorn/no-await-expression-member',
});

for await (const { prompt, relativeFilePath } of promptWithRelativeFilePaths) {
  console.log('User:', prompt);
  const response =
    await $`OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434 aider ${relativeFilePath} --message "${prompt}" --model ollama/llama3.1 --no-auto-commits --yes --subtree-only`;
  console.log('AI:', response.stdout);
}
```

A couple of notes about the options passed into `aider`:

1. By passing in the `relativeFilePath`, `aider` will only modify that file. `aider` [still has context about the rest of the codebase](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#how-can-i-add-all-the-files-to-the-chat)
   so we do not need add the rest of the files explicitly.
2. `--message` is the prompt that is given to the LLM. Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to `aider`
   multiple prompts through the CLI.
3. `--no-auto-commits` is important because we want to review the changes before they are committed. By default,
   `aider` will commit the changes it has made with an appropriate commit message.
4. `--yes` is used to automatically accept any prompt that `aider` gives which is useful for running `aider` programmatically
   given that we cannot interactively respond to `aider`.
5. `--subtree-only` is useful for large monorepos and ensures that `aider` is only looking at files in the
   current working directory rather than from the `git` root. This also enables using relative file paths from
   the current working directory rather than from the `git` root.

I had some success with this approach but I found that there were some issues that `llama3.1 8B`
was not able to adequately fix. Given that `aider` has good support for many different LLMs,
investigating the performance of the [leading LLMs](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/) would be a good next step.

## Overall

This article is not about providing a single silver bullet to fix all ESLint issues in a codebase. But,
hopefully by using a combination of `eslint-interactive`, `grit`, `aider` and other tools, you can vastly
reduce the number of issues that require human intervention and focus on delivering business value.

I think it's important to note that choosing which tools you want to use to resolve a specific set of ESLint
rules will be very important in determining the success of your efforts.

It is also important to remember that it is acceptable to have existing violations that are not fixed
immediately. It is usually not worthwhile investing in the developer effort to make a codebase fully
compliant but it is absolutely worthwhile ensuring that future changes are less bug-prone, more consistent
and more maintainable.
